# END-EFFECT THIS!  
## STUDENT DESIGN CHALLENGE (Open to All Arizona Students)

### AIVN & REVOBOTS invite you to DESIGN the Future of Work

REVOBOTS is a robotics startup developing TASKBOT‚Äîan AI-powered, 3D-printed humanoid built to take on real-world tasks and help shape the future of work.

As part of TASKBOT‚Äôs North American debut at the AIVN Showcase on April 17th, AIVN and REVOBOTS want to see your boldest idea for what TASKBOT should do next.

Design a one-of-a-kind end effector‚Äîa tool, gripper, gadget, whatever‚Äîthat attaches to the end of a robotic arm (like TASKBOT) and helps get real work done. Whether it‚Äôs cleaning, sorting, building, fixing, farming, or something totally new‚Äîwe want to see what you come up with.  
**Think safer. Smarter. More inventive. More impactful. More useful.**

We‚Äôre looking for inventive, original designs that solve real problems, demonstrate how AI-driven robots can collaborate with humans, and feel like they could actually be built‚Äîno PhD required.

You can submit:
- A 3D-printed output  
- CAD file  
- 3D rendering or animation  
- Labeled sketch  
- Photo of a mockup  
- AI-generated concept  
- One-page write-up explaining what it does and why it matters  
- *(Optional)* A 1‚Äì2 minute video pitch or demo
